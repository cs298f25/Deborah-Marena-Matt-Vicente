#Development Process
For our Github workflow, we use the simple workflow where we directly push pull to our main repo
Before making any changes, each member is expected to pull to have an up to date repo.
Each member is expected to push their finished work in small increments to avoid 
merge conflicts, as well as with detailed messages to keep other members up to date.
